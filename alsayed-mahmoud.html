    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: August 2, 2025</p>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Alsayed Mahmoud for Mathematics</strong> application, developed and maintained as a private educational platform for Egyptian high school students and their teacher. The application is designed to provide secure, interactive, and curriculum-aligned learning experiences for students aged 16 and above.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following personal information during account registration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full name</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Phone number</li>
      <li>Parent/Guardian phone number</li>
      <li>Password</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This information is used solely to manage student-teacher interaction and maintain personalized learning records. No sensitive or financial information is collected.</p>

    <h2>2. Permissions Required</h2>
    <p>The application may request access to the following device features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera & Microphone:</strong> For interactive learning sessions, oral problem explanations, or video-based assignments, as required by the teacher.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Only if necessary to cache educational content locally.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Location access is NOT requested.</strong></p>

    <h2>3. No Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>This application does not share, sell, or distribute user data to any third-party services. It does not use Google, Facebook, Firebase, or analytics integrations. The app is fully self-hosted and all data remains private to the teacher’s system.</p>

    <h2>4. Use of YouTube Videos</h2>
    <p>Some lessons include embedded YouTube videos (e.g., math tutorials, concept demonstrations). These videos are streamed directly from YouTube’s servers. While no direct YouTube login is required, YouTube may collect standard usage data according to their own policies.</p>

    <h2>5. Tracking Learning Progress</h2>
    <p>The app tracks the following learning-related data internally:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Video watch time</li>
      <li>Quiz scores</li>
      <li>Assignment completion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used exclusively by the teacher to monitor and improve student performance. It is not shared externally.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>All student data is retained for one academic semester only. At the end of each semester, the teacher resets the platform and deletes all previous records.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Deletion Requests</h2>
    <p>Students who wish to have their data deleted may contact the teacher directly via phone, WhatsApp, or in person. There is no in-app deletion feature since the system is privately managed for educational purposes only.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app is intended for students aged 16 and older. It is not designed for children under 13 years of age, and no parental consent mechanism is implemented, as the platform is not directed at children under that age.</p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>All data is securely stored on the teacher’s private server. Reasonable technical safeguards are in place to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure of student information.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact:</p>
