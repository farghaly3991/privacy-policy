    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: August 2, 2025</p>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Al3ameed Platform for Arabic Language</strong>, developed and maintained as a private educational platform for Egyptian secondary school students and their Arabic language teacher. The platform is designed to enhance students’ mastery of Arabic grammar, literature, and writing through interactive lessons and exercises.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>During account registration, the following personal information may be collected:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full name</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Phone number</li>
      <li>Parent/Guardian phone number</li>
      <li>Password</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This information is used solely for managing communication between the teacher and students and for tracking learning progress. No financial or sensitive personal data is collected.</p>

    <h2>2. Permissions Required</h2>
    <p>The application may request access to certain device features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera & Microphone:</strong> Used for oral language activities, pronunciation practice, and interactive sessions guided by the teacher.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Used only when necessary to download or cache educational materials locally for offline access.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The app does not request access to location data.</strong></p>

    <h2>3. No Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Al3ameed Platform</strong> does not share or sell user data to any external party. It does not integrate with Google, Facebook, Firebase, or analytics services. All user data remains private and stored within the teacher’s own system.</p>

    <h2>4. Use of YouTube Videos</h2>
    <p>Some Arabic lessons may include embedded YouTube videos (for example, poetry recitations or classical Arabic explanations). These videos are streamed directly from YouTube’s servers, and YouTube may collect usage data according to its own privacy policy. No YouTube account or login is required to view the videos.</p>

    <h2>5. Learning Progress Tracking</h2>
    <p>The platform records educational performance data such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lesson completion status</li>
      <li>Video watch duration</li>
      <li>Quiz and test scores</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data helps the teacher evaluate and support each student’s progress. It is never shared outside the teacher’s system.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Student data is kept for one academic semester. After the semester ends, the teacher resets the platform and deletes all stored data to ensure privacy and compliance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Deletion Requests</h2>
    <p>Students can request data deletion by contacting the teacher directly (via phone, WhatsApp, or in person). There is no automated in-app deletion feature, as the platform operates under a private teacher-student environment.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This platform is intended for students aged 16 years and older. It is not designed for use by children under 13 years of age, and no parental consent mechanism is included, as the app is not directed toward younger children.</p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>All data is securely stored on the teacher’s private server. Technical measures are implemented to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of student data.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact:</p>
    <p><strong>Al3ameed Teacher</strong><br>
    Email: <a href="mailto:example@example.com">example@example.com</a><br>
    Phone: [Teacher's Contact Number]</p>

    <p>By using the Al3ameed Platform for Arabic Language, you acknowledge and agree to this privacy policy.</p>
